# AIR-QUALITY-MONITORING-MOBILE-APPLICATION-
A mobile application that delivers air quality values based on the userâ€™s locations and selected health condition


The project examined the most significant air pollutants and the effects they have on human health, collected data on the air quality index (AQI) from numerous stations, and investigated the best back-end and front-end technologies in order to achieve its goal. The mobile application uses an Application Programmable Interface (API) to quickly retrieve the air quality data and is compatible with both the Android and iOS operating systems. The ultimate result of this project is a mobile application that only uses an API to send AQI data to users for more than 500 stations worldwide upon request. Other features include search and the ability to save favorite places, all of which are customized to the user's chosen health status.
